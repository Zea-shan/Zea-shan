# Binary Search and Linear Search Implementation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of two fundamental searching algorithms:
- **Linear Search**
- **Binary Search**

The purpose of this project is to provide hands-on experience with searching algorithms and their time complexities.

## How to Run the Program
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/binary-linear-search.git
   cd binary-linear-search
Run the Python Script:
python binary_linear_search.py
Purpose
Linear Search: A straightforward algorithm that checks each element in the list sequentially.
Binary Search: An efficient algorithm for searching in a sorted list using a divide-and-conquer approach.
TIME COMPLEXITY:
Linear Search: 
𝑂(𝑛)

Binary Search:
Best Case: 
𝑂(1)

Worst Case: 
𝑂(log𝑛)

The program also prints the worst-case time complexity of Binary Search.

Example Output
sql
Copy
Edit
Linear Search: Element 15 found at index 4
Binary Search: Element 15 found at index 4
Binary Search Worst-Case Time Complexity: O(log n)
